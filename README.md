# projectAlpha 
is a project that me an a couple of friends are making in order to understand Kotlin better. It is not trying to replace any
documentatiion or anything like that. It is just made for pure kotlin n00bie purposes. At first, we are writing a documentation in order to
check syntax, later we will create a simple project powered fully by Kotlin.
